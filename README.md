# Paraphrase-Detection

Paraphrase detection is the process of finding whether two sentences have the same meaning or not.

We use TensorFlow which is a DeepLearning library for the project. We use a BiLSTM for the matching vectors. 
The model was trained on MSPR corpus and has an accuracy of 72%. Pretrained GLoVe word embeddings where used which are of 300 dimensions.

A 2 layered feed forward Neural Network is used for the final prediction and a softmax layer is used.
